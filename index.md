- **Characterization of Microwave Plasma for Electromagnetic Modeling in Processing Applications** (Jan 2022-Present)
    - Summary: Microwave induced lab plasmas have demonstrated well-documented and signifigant improvements to efficiency of a variety of industrial applications (including: ). Electromagnetic modeling is a cruicial step towards implementing these technologies but plasma comes with serveral modelling challenges. It is common to characterize plasma by its electric conductivity, but when we consider what this means for real applications, the electric conductivity of plasma is not only difficult to measure, but it is not even directly linked to more measurable quantities of the system (ie. pressure, power, gas flow rate, volume, ect.). My work on this subject makes three major contributions to this area of uncertainty:
