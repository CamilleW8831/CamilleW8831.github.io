### Characterization of Microwave Plasma for Electromagnetic Modeling in Processing Applications (Jan 2022-Present)
**Summary:** 

Microwave induced lab plasmas have demonstrated well-documented and signifigant improvements to efficiency of a variety of industrial applications (including: ). Electromagnetic modeling is a cruicial step towards implementing these technologies but plasma comes with serveral modeling challenges. It is common to characterize plasma by its electric conductivity. However, when we consider what this means for real applications, the electric conductivity of plasma is not only difficult to measure, but also has no generalized link to more measurable/controllable parameters (ie. pressure, power, gas flow rate, volume, ect.). My and my co-author's work on this subject makes three major contributions to this area of uncertainty:
- Description of the relationships between plasma and physical parameters of the MW system. This includes physics-based models and their corresponding assumtions. If paramter dependancies are system-defined this is specified 
- A computationally verified Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) EM modeling appraoch in software * * QuickWave * *. FDTD has the advantage of computational efficiency over Finite-Element Method (FEM) when used for single-physics applications.
